# Sapphire's final for Python Data and Design spring 2023
This is a silly little text game based on imagination called The Big Final Adventure! It uses D&D stats system.
To reroll stats, save the python file again.

Take your dog or cat along as you experience an absurd adventure -- just to hand in your final project! 
If you fail, you will also fail this class!!
You don't want that to happen, right?
